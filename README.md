# Numerical analysis

In this repository are listed some of the pieces of code I used back when I was an undergraduate student majoring in Physics. This subject tought me a lot about numerical approximations under C language.

Later on I will add graphs or a notebook to show the results.

Most of the code has comments albeit in Spanish.
